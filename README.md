# Calculator-using-JS
It's a simple calculator project where I had used HTML5 and CSS for designing it's layout and used some basic JavaScript functions, which are following:
eval(operand1+operator+operator2) ---------> It changes text to numereric value and evaluates.
getAttributes---------------> getAttribute function is used to fetch the values that are assinged to the attribute like here:
                              this.getAttribute('data-value') ----> gives the value of 'data-value' attribute that were assigned during html
                              
parseFloat(text)---------> function is used to change text to numeric value
addEventListner is used to get the values on which the user clicks..it record clicks
*text.includes(.) return if the text has decimal already present in it.
